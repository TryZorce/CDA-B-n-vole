## Context

Project context
As a full-stack developer, you will develop your client's application using PHP, HTML, JS, and CSS. You are responsible for the complete development of the application, from design to final demonstration.

The client wants to bring together the entire volunteer registration and management system into a single solution. This application is intended for two uses:

* A volunteer registration process.
* An administration panel for managing volunteer lists.

All information necessary for the proper development of the project can be found in the attached specifications document.

Users can register as volunteers by filling out a three-part public form that collects their personal information, availability and mission preferences, and any comments. Once the form is validated and submitted, the data is verified and processed on both the frontend and backend, then saved in a CSV file. The volunteer receives a unique access code to their personal space, where they can view the missions offered to them.

The form includes fields such as name, first name, age, gender, phone number, email address, region, availability, and preferred positions. The data is secured and verified before being saved in the database.

Volunteers can access their personal space by entering their unique code on the login page. They will find their personal information, registration date, and preferences entered in the form.

The system also includes an administration panel accessible to administrators, who can create events and assign volunteers to them. The events are saved in a CSV file, and administrators can view the list of volunteers assigned to each event. Volunteers can also view their missions from their personal space.

## Technical Notes:

CSS framework allowed.
No PHP / JS framework.
No library.

## Documentation

This brief was a group project.
We decided to create a PHP/JS project. We started by analyzing the [Specifications](https://drive.proton.me/urls/6D7K86X77M#4HUSz4PXzCo3) and creating a [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/TBmLijsT/ATTI3953bfd60b31c70f42a970fe29158566BD818D68/cda-benevole) board to organize ourselves.
We also created a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/yVtQeYGXyL6YRe5XMTwax3/B%C3%A9n%C3%A9vole?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=ZMnAM3p3tGa3nlPS-1) mockup to organize our future site.
We have also created a [Github](https://github.com/TryZorce/CDA-Benevole) repository to share our code.
